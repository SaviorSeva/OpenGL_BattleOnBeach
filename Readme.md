## How to run
In the root directory of our project, run 
```sh
python3 main.py
```

## Requirement
To run the project, the following libraries need to be installed :
```sh
AssimpCy
glfw
numpy
PyOpenGL
```
## List of Features
- One directional light as sunlight;
- Textured models
- Different light renderer
    - Phong model
    - Lambertian model
- Non flat terrain generated by hmap file;
- One mesh based terrain with multiple texture using texture mapping;
- Cat musketeer standing on the boat using hierarchical modeling; 
- Trees on the grass part of terrain generated with random position;
- Stones on the beach part of terrain generated with random position; 
- Boats floating on the water with weaving animations;
- Seagulls flying in the sky following a predefined circle with keyframe animation;
- Timer can be reset to 0 with space key;
- Seagulls and musketeers loaded with skeletal animatons;
- Move the musketeer on the beach with controls;
- Different actions for the musketeer on the beach (idle, run, jump, pose).

## Controls
- WASD Key for moving camera position;
- Q, E key to move camera up and down;
- UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrow key for moving camera yaw and pitch;
- Key 1, 2 and 0 for predefined camera position and angle;
- IJKL keys to move the musketeer on the beach;
- U and O to trigger jump and pose action on the musketeer;
- Space key to reset all animations;
- P key to pass different polygon mode (Display the actual model, the edge of triangles or the vertice of model).

## Who did what
All of us contribute to the designing phase and the coding phase.

## About reference.txt
Contains the source where we get the models and textures, and some online tutorial we followed.
